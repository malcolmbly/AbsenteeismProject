# AbsenteeismProject

This was a project that I completed as part of "The Data Science Course 2020" on Udemy. This project used a basic logistic regression with SKlearn.

Some skills that I learned in this was creating modules, which was my first exposure to OOP in Python, and I also used a bit of Tableau for data visualization.
